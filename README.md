# lib-tex

A variant of the texlive 2017 distribution, but adapted for cross-compiling and with function calls in a library. I made it so I could use pdftex and luatex on iOS, but there are other uses. 

To compile: call "./build_command.sh" 



pdftex and luatex as a library. Developped for iOS, but should work on all systems.
